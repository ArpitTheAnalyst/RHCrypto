# RHCrypto
RHCrypto is a unbreakable encryption type made with the formula kiss(keep it simple sweety). it encrypts your message with one time way or cypher. In this way this message have trillions of combinations that seems impossible to break without cypher text

## USES

One can use it in the way of creating a file of some random text sentence and name it 1-10 or so onn.
send the list to the receiver , and keeping it hidden from everyone else
once the messge is encrypted with any cypher b/w 1-10 , receiver knows what is the first cypher for decryption process

### REQUIREMENTS

```
PYFIGLET 
For Windows https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/f9/02/48293654fb2e4fdeb4d927f00a380230a832744b6c9af757373a72d018d1/pyfiglet-0.8.post1.tar.gz
For Linux pip install pyfiglet
```

### HOW TO USE IT ?

RHCrypto is as easy as logging inn to github...

## Installation and Running
```
1. git clone https://github.com/rockyhandsm2k/RHCrypto.git 
2. cd RHCrypto/
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. python encrypter.py // for encryption
5. python decryption.py // for decryption
```

## ENCRYPTING

+ Run encrypter.py file first

+ just final up your one time random cypher

+ enter the cypher first
+ enter your msg of the same length of cypher 

+ voila completed....copy your message and send it

## DECRYPTING

+ Run decrypter.py file first

+ write the one time cypher used
+ enter encrypted message

+ voila completed....read your message..its for u
```

Entering "helloworld" in the cypher text of encrypter.py and due to number of words used (10 in this case)
we will enter 10 character or alphabetical message like "heytesting" that will bring us up the entire message which is not encrypted

and vice versa works for decrypter.py 

```

## First Dish From rockyhandsm2k to Github

getting inspired from the codes written on the github ..i decided to put my first code on github..

## Built With

* PYTHON 3.7.6

## Version 1.0

As code been recently developed we give it a version 1.0

## Authors

* **Arpit Gupta** - *Initial work* - [Rockyhandsm2k](https://github.com/rockyhandsm2k)

## Acknowledgments

* Inspiration

## Cons:
 + It would be as easy to break for others to break the msg as it is for you , only if one gets the list of cypher you made.
 + One can only encrypt the message containing letters same as the cypher...leading to it neither can use more words than cypher nor less
 + LAST but not the least..RHCrypto does not support symbols or signs of your keyboard or others and nor even spacebar...so your message can't be "hello_world or 
   "hello world" 
 ## it can only be "helloworld" no spaces and symbols  at all..
